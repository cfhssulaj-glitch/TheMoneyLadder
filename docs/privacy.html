  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective Date: March 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Money Ladder ("the App") is a personal finance planning tool. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the App collects and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All financial data you enter into the App (income, expenses, debts, savings) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not transmit, collect, or store your financial information on any server.</p>

  <h2>No Account Required</h2>
  <p>The App does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or sign in with any service.</p>

  <h2>Purchase Information</h2>
  <p>If you purchase a subscription or lifetime access, the transaction is processed by Apple through the App Store. We use RevenueCat, a third-party service, to manage purchase validation and subscription status. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID and purchase receipt from Apple — it does not receive your financial data. For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
  <p>The App does not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or crash reports.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The only third-party service used by the App is RevenueCat for in-app purchase management. No other third-party services receive data from the App.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@themoneyladder.app">support@themoneyladder.app</a>.</p>
